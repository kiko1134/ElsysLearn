Our project is a site inspired by the platform "ucha.se", which will be focused specifically on the subjects at the Technological School "Electronic Systems" at TU. All video lessons on the website will be recorded and processed by us, which would facilitate the comprehension and understanding of the information by students.

For more information about our project you can check our wiki page.
